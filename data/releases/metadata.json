                The 1st album by Vox Populi.  It was originally released on PyrE Records 
                in a limited edition of 200 and was re-released by us as our first offering 
                in a pressing of 1000.  It is hand printed by us and the band on recycled 
                paperboard and features 3 panels of blockprinting artwork and lettering hand
                cut by a member of the band!!  Satyagraha is a moody post-punk album of 
                poignant intellect, sensible radicalism, soulful aggression, and melodic noise.  
                We loved it enough to start a label to put it out!!!

                Their 2nd Album, widely considered their "Art-record".  Pathos documents 
                the more theatric/concept side of Vox Populi swaying from a 15 minute thematic 
                punk "rock opera" to spoken word/ambient explorations to melodic beauty and 
                full on noise arrangements.  Their most adventurous record that manages to 
                capture a remarkable diversity with an astounding sense of identity and 
                cohesion.  personal fave of the band.

                Hovel's 6 song knockout! Heavy, Groovy, instrumental rock that fills the 
                void between the Monstrousness of the Melvins, the Soul Darkness of Sabbath, 
                and the Heavy edge of early Helmet..  They dont say a word...but you know 
                just what theyre sayin!  Hovel is a virtual supergroup of highly proficient 
                musicians who strip away all pretense and focus on making a record thats 
                true, and a record that rocks.

                In the desert
                I saw a creature, naked, bestial,
                Who, squatting upon the ground,
                Held his heart in his hands,
                And ate of it.<br/>
                I said, <em>"Is it good, friend?"</em><br/>
                <em>"It is bitter-bitter,"</em> he answered;
                <em>"But I like it</em>

                <em>And because it is my heart."</em><br/>
