Hovel was formed in the fall of 2002 when long time friends resurfaced         and churned-out a set's worth of material.Impatient and frustrated         searching for the right vocalist Hovel chose to let their songs stand         on their own as instrumentals. Hovel is currently finishing up mixing         on their long overdue album and perfoming brawling -it -out live shows         in dives and flophouses around the region.",

This dark and mysterious         band sounds as if a very clean-cut and tattoo-free X cut the sound track         for an independent movie..... The difference between [the]N.U.R.B-S and         the earlier Ventures/Dick Dale/Beach Boys sound is the difference between         LA punk and Phil Spector pop -- it's darker, and reflective of a society         without optimism and struggling to get by. While things might get pretty bad,        dating and surfing are still options, but the beach is polluted and everyone         has an STD.'

            "description": "        Their 2nd Album, widely considered their 'Art-record'.  Pathos documents        the more theatric/concept side of Vox Populi swaying from a 15 minute thematic         punk 'rock opera' to spoken word/ambient explorations to melodic beauty and         full on noise arrangements.  Their most adventurous record that manages to         capture a remarkable diversity with an astounding sense of identity and         cohesion.  personal fave of the band.",

Satyagraha is a moody post-punk album of         poignant intellect, sensible radicalism, soulful aggression, and melodic noise.        We loved it enough to start a label to put it out!!!",
