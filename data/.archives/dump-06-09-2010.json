            "description": "        The 1st album by Vox Populi.  It was originally released on PyrE Records         in a limited edition of 200 and was re-released by us as our first offering         in a pressing of 1000.  It is hand printed by us and the band on recycled         paperboard and features 3 panels of blockprinting artwork and lettering hand        cut by a member of the band!!  Satyagraha is a moody post-punk album of         poignant intellect, sensible radicalism, soulful aggression, and melodic noise.        We loved it enough to start a label to put it out!!!",
